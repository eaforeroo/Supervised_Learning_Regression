# Supervised Learning: Regression

Introduction

Results of a previous analysis of the climatological data of the ENSO phenomenon, better known as "El Ni√±o", through the linear regression techniques selected to obtain a better estimation of the behaviour metrics of the data, in this case, the temperature of the seawater in the area of interest. This document consists of the following sections:

1. Main objective of our data analysis

2. Brief description of the chosen data set

3. Data exploration, cleaning and feature engineering scheme

4. Linear regression models application

5. Linear regression model selection to apply to the data set

6. Summary Key Findings and Insights

7. Suggestions for next steps
